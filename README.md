# This is a collection of my Python 3 utilities

- `Logger.py` set up a logger which supports console, rolling file, and/or SMTP logging methods 
  - `addArgs(parser:argparse.ArgumentParser)` adds command line arguments for setting up logging
  - `mkLogger(args:argparse.ArgumentParser, fmt:str, name:str)` uses the args to setup the logger
    - *fmt* is the logging message format, by default "%(asctime)s %(threadName)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s"
    - *name* is the logger to setup

- `Thread.py` is a *threading.Thread* class which catches exceptions and sends them to a queue. Then the main thread can wait on the queue for a problem to arise in any of the threads.

- `INotify.py` is a thread which waits for modifications in a file system then forwards the modifications to a set of queues for other threads to process. It handles adding/removing of directories.

- `GreatCircle.py` calculates great circle distances on the earth in meters
